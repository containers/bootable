# Developer Certificate of Origin

Add a ```Signed-off-by``` line to commit messages to indicate that you
certify that you wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code that
you are contributing to the project.

Here is the [full text of the DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a
```Signed-off-by``` line to commit messages.

This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

    $ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
